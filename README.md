# Dots gray

### simple dots for my arch linux setup

## stuff I used:

- grapjuice for roblox.
- bspwm as my WM
- dunst as my notification manager
- eww for the top bar and widgets
- gtk config for themes, etc.
- kitty as my terminal emulator
- nvim and micro as text editors
- neofetch duh...
- picom as the compositor
- rofi for the app launcher
- spicetify for spotify (duhh)
- sxhkd as the keybind manager, there's some of my personal keybinds in it
- xfce for config

## about eww

the command inside `bspwm/bspwmrc` used to start eww should be changed because i have eww installed on a folder called `.repos`, so if you installed eww via the AUR then you should change

`$ ~/.repos/eww/target/release/eww open bar`

to

`$ eww open bar`
